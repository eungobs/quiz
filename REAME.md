# Quiz Application

## Overview

This is a simple Node.js-based quiz application. The quiz consists of multiple questions about the Limpopo province, and it is designed to test the userâ€™s knowledge within a set time limit. 

## Features

- **Timed Questions**: Each question has a countdown timer, and the total quiz duration is also timed.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Questions are handled asynchronously to ensure smooth interaction without blocking the main event loop.
- **Dynamic Question Handling**: The quiz progresses to the next question automatically after the current question is answered or when the time for the question runs out.
- **Quiz Termination**: The quiz ends when all questions are answered or when the total time runs out. The final score is displayed upon termination.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles invalid user input and times out gracefully.
