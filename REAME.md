Quiz Application

Overview
This is a simple Node.js-based quiz application. The quiz consists of multiple questions about the Limpopo province, and it is designed to test the userâ€™s knowledge within a set time limit.

Features
Timed Questions: Each question has a countdown timer, and the total quiz duration is also timed.
Asynchronous Operations: Questions are handled asynchronously to ensure smooth interaction without blocking the main event loop.
Dynamic Question Handling: The quiz progresses to the next question automatically after the current question is answered or when the time for the question runs out.
Quiz Termination: The quiz ends when all questions are answered or when the total time runs out. The final score is displayed upon termination.
Error Handling: The application handles invalid user input and times out gracefully.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can verify this by running:


node -v
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/eungobs/quiz.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd quiz-app
Install dependencies:


npm install
Install readline-sync (if it's part of your codebase):

How to Use the Quiz

Start the quiz by running the following command:
node app.js

The quiz will begin, and you will see the questions one by one along with the available options.

As the timer counts down, enter the number of the correct answer and press Enter.

If you answer before the timer runs out, the quiz will automatically move to the next question.

If you do not answer within the given time, the application will display a "Time is up!" message and proceed to the next question.

When all the questions are answered or the total quiz time runs out, the quiz will end automatically, displaying your final score.

The application will then exit on its own.
